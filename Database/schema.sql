-- Booleans have only two possible values, so naturally values will be repeated
-- for many rows.  However, boolean values are so small that it would take more
-- space to store a table of the mappings to true/false than is needed to simply
-- store the value.  When there are multiple boolean columns in a table, the
-- values can be packed into the same byte, further saving space.
--
-- TODO: The timestamps really should be broken out into their own table.
--
-- The nullable fields are most likely to be null or different for the majority
-- of events.  They could be stored separately, but it might not be worth doing.
--
-- The summary text and description text in the calendar aren't necessarily in a
-- "speech-friendly" form, it is not practical to manually translate each event.
-- It may be desirable instead to design a translation function that can strip
-- unspeakable items (eg. HTML, URLs), and translate a few important words into
-- the proper SSML (eg. how to pronounce "Beaujolais").
