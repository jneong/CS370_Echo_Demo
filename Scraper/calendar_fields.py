#!/usr/bin/env python2.7

"""
This module contains functions for fetching SSU event calendars and
extracting information from the data structures.

The file is structured such that the functions that deal with handling
the calendar info can be imported from a shell or another Python script,
or this module itself can be run as a standalone program.

As a standalone program, this script fetches the SSU event calendars in
iCalendar format, parses the calendars using the vobject library, analyzes
the data to answer questions of interest, and outputs the results in
Markdown format.

To generate the results, run the following command in a bash shell:

    ./calendar_fields.py > CalendarFields.md

There are two dependencies required for this script: requests and vobject.

Requests is a friendlier wrapper around the Python libraries for performing
HTTP requests.
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

VObject is a versatile iCalendar library that came out of the Chandler project.
http://eventable.github.io/vobject/

Using a virtualenv for this project is recommended.  If you aren't familiar
with virtualenv, it is well worth taking a few moments to become acquainted
with.  Users of PyCharm will be glad to know that virtualenv is integrated into
the IDE.

The descriptions of Python in the comments of this file are supposed to only
reflect the behavior of Python 2.7. as that is what Amazon make available on
Lambda.  Python 3.x is generally similar but better in just about every way.
Prefer Python 3.x where possible.  Curses, Amazon.

The following third-party libraries are required to run this script.
They can be installed with pip:

pip install requests vobject

Alternatively, PyCharm has its own interface for installing Python packages.

# The "Calendars as a Service" service that SSU uses is based on a calendar
# server called Trumba.  Trumba provides users with a way to add custom fields
# to their calendars, using a custom iCalendar object type.
#
# All the custom fields are the same field type as far as the iCalendar format
# is concerned so we get them in a list of all the values for that type.  The
# custom fields are differentiated by params (parameters).  The field params
# can be accessed as a dictionary object, using a parameter name to obtain a
# list of the parameter's values.
#
# Trumba's custom field has several parameters, but the interesting ones here
# are ID, NAME, and TYPE.
# ID and NAME are alternative representations of the same information.
# TYPE is a sometimes misleading description of how the value for the custom
# field is encoded.  For example, 'SingleLine' would be a single line text field.
# 'Boolean' would be a True/False value.  But number actually can mean an
# enumeration, in other words a selection from a list of values.  In the case of

# If you aren't yet familiar with map() and reduce(), they are staples of
# data processing.  If you've ever heard of Hadoop, that's a glorified way
# of doing map()/reduce().
#
# I'll introduce both concepts here for completeness, though only reduce is
# used at this point.
#
# map(func, sequence, ...) => applies func() to each element in the sequence,
#   and returns a list of the results.  See the help text for more details.
# Basically equivalent to:
#   def map(func, sequence):
#       return [func(elem) for elem in sequence]
#
# reduce(func, sequence) => applies func() to each element in the sequence and
#   the result of the previous iteration.  For the first cycle, the first two
#   elements from the sequence are used.  There is an optional initializer that
#   can be provided.  See the help text for more details.
#   Returns the final result as a single value.
# Basically equivalent to:
#   def reduce(func, sequence):
#       it = iter(sequence)
#       result = next(it)
#       for elem in it:
#           result = func(result, elem)
#       return result
#
# In other words, map() transforms one sequence into another sequence using a
# unary operator func(), while reduce() collapses a sequence into a single value
# using a binary operator func(). (unary:= one operand, binary:= two operands)

# Here we are creating a custom reducer function.
#
# Given some series of events, and a selector function that selects values we are
# interested in from an event, we want to find the set of unique values obtained
# from all the events.
#
# To do so, we gather the values from each event using selector(), then obtain the
# set of those results (set in the math sense, where each discrete value occurs at
# most once within the set) using the Python built-in set() function. When we have
# collected a set of items for each event, we find the union of all the sets, using
# the reduce() built-in to apply the set.union() operator across every set, and
# return the result.
#
# The actual implementation is pleasantly concise:

# One thing worth mentioning is the use of the list comprehension.
# For those not familiar with Python, a list comprehension is a compact
# way to write a simple for loop.  In the above code, the list comprehension is:
#   [set(selector(event)) for event in events]
# This is roughly equivalent to:
#   result = []
#   for event in events:
#       result.append( set( selector(event) ) )
# There are also dictionary comprehensions, generator comprehensions, which might
# have made more sense here, and set comprehensions, which sound like they could
# be used above given all the set operations we were doing, but probably wouldn't
# actually be very useful for the specific task at hand.
#
# Anyway, comprehensions are cool, so get used to them.
